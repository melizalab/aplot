## Installing aplot on debian 7

Aplot depends on some old libraries and can be tricky to install. Currently
there is a statically-linked copy of aplot in trex:/sw/atools/bin which should
work on most machines. If you need to compile it yourself, these instructions
should work on Debian 7:

Add non-free repository to apt-get sources. Edit /etc/apt/source.list, and make
sure the first two sources are as follows:

    deb http://mirror.anl.gov/debian/ wheezy main non-free
    deb-src http://mirror.anl.gov/debian/ wheezy main non-free

Install prerequisites:

    sudo apt-get install darcs libmotif-dev libxp-dev libxmu-dev libxft-dev libfftw3-dev libhdf5-dev scons

Get copies of the source from trex:

    darcs get trex:/home/darcs/libdataio
    darcs get trex:/home/darcs/libsono
    darcs get trex:/home/darcs/aplot

Build the support libraries:

    cd libdataio; scons -Q
    cd ../libsono; make
    cd ..

Build aplot:

    cd aplot
    make aplot && make install

    1.  What is it?
    ---------------
       Aplot is a program for handling time-series data, especially:
            o sampled data recorded from sound cards, A/D converters, etc.
            o times of occurrences of neuronal action potentials (the
               spiking activity of cells in the nervous system)
            o labels that annotate times or spans of time relative to the
               above types of data.

       Aplot can provide multiple views of multiple files simultaneously,
       scrolling and zooming through these files very quickly, and keeping
       multiple plots in a window in temporal register.

       It provides the following types of plots (all with time on x-axis):
            o sonogram - frequency on y-axis, power as shades of gray/color
            o oscillogram - amplitude on y-axis
            o label - text markers that label times or spans of time
            o raster - neuronal spikes as dots relative to an event
            o PSTH - histogram of neuronal activity relative to an event
            o ISI - histogram of inter-spike intervals
            o a few other plots

       It has been extensively used and developed over almost 8 years,
       primarily for the study of neuronal and microphone recordings
       in an auditory and motor neurophysiology setting.

       In addition to visualizing data on-screen, aplot can produce
       high quality postscript and EPS printouts and saved files of
       these plots.  The encapsulated postscript files can be imported
       into commercial drawing programs such as CorelDraw(TM).

       Aplot can also play sampled data through soundcards, mixing multiple
       channels into mono or stereo channels, and marking on its plots
       the samples being played in real-time.

    4.  REQUIREMENTS
    ----------------
        To compile, aplot requires:
            gcc
            g77
            Motif libraries (lesstif once worked, maybe it still does)

        In the past, aplot has been compiled on SunOS, Solaris, Digital
        UNIX, and even VMS.  However, it has changed much since then.
        Right now, it should compile with minimal required changes on just
        about any modern Unix or Unix-like system.  I have not tried using
        the cygwin environment.


    5.  INSTALL
    -----------

        See INSTALL file for instructions


    6.  FIRST-TIME USAGE
    --------------------


    7.  FAQ
    -------
        1) What does aplot stand for?
            amish's plot (I'm not too creative...)

        2) What file formats does aplot use?
            ...see dataio library...

        3) What wacky indent style did you use?
            Hey, I have very large monitors, and like small fonts.
            I don't care if my code is more than 80 chars wide.
            I really dislike:
                for (i=0; i < 10; i++) {
                    /* do something */
                }
            I really prefer:
                for (i=0; i < 10; i++)
                {
                    /* do something */
                }
            I use 4 character width tabs.
            And by the way, vile/xvile is the editor of kings.

    8.  THEORY OF OPERATION
    -----------------------
        <under construction>

        Aplot is a single threaded program using X11/Xt and Motif.
